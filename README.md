# codingquiz

## Description

I designed a coding quiz. First, you'll see a brief introduction and a "Start" button.
Answer correctly, and you'll see a celebratory gif with a "Damn Right!" caption. 
If you get a question wrong, the timer drops by 10 seconds. Remember, your final score is the remaining time. 
Once done, you can add your initials to the highscore board. This leaderboard lets you see top scores, clear entries, or dive back into the quiz.
